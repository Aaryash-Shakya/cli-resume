# Uninstallation

If you need to uninstall the `aaryash` package, follow these steps based on how you installed it:  

### Global Installation  

If you installed the package globally using `npm install -g`, you can remove it with:  

```sh
npm uninstall -g aaryash
```  


### Local Installation  

If you installed the package locally in a directory, navigate to the directory where it was installed and run:  

```sh
npm uninstall aaryash
```  

If you used `npx` to run the package without installation, there's no need for uninstallation, as it was not stored locally.
